#Hi Employers, WTF!

So its no secret that I have been looking for work

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am currently looking for a new iOS role. Any takers? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jobhunting?src=hash">#jobhunting</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ios?src=hash">#ios</a></p>&mdash; Edwin Bosire (@edwinbosire) <a href="https://twitter.com/edwinbosire/status/616199167363444738">July 1, 2015</a></blockquote>

And I've been investigating the companies with open roles just as much as they would me. And I noticed something, most of the tech companies out there neither have an open source culture or even a github account, that would be fine if they a tech blog to counter this, but the worst offenders seem not to give back to the society at all. 

### Won't name no names

I've downloaded apps that are clearly using AFNetworking (who isn't) and probably a pleathora of other open source components to support their apps, and there is no attribution to the publishers of these components, no giving back to the community either by enhancing the components, blogging about their use or open sourcing their own solutions.

I know of companies that dont share **anything**, and their developers don't learn much either, these are establishment only concerned about their own, and their own usually isn't that great. 

A lack of sharing leads to writing code for a specific purpose, this makes it hard to reuse components even within the organization.

#### Don't be a leach

Don't be a leach, theres so much to open sourcing than publishing on Github, there is so much to learn from the process, put your code out there, receive criticism, learn, evolve, be better.

What I know is, companies that write good software are not scared of public criticism, if you write good software you would not be afraid to show the world. What you show (or hide) says a lot about your organization.

So in short, when a company gets in contact, I scrutinize their Github and Bitbucket pages before I even read their manifesto, and this is where I make my decision.

PS: I am not hitting out at any company in particular, what I look for in an employer is not necessarily what others are after, so take the above as opinion of a bitter developer.
