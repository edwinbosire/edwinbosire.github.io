Welcome to my blog, here I will be writing whatever I wish, after all, it is my blog.

Posts will be about tech and programming, but on the off chance I am a bit moody, there could be insane rants ending in tears and regrets.

I want to keep an online journal of whatever I am learning in the hopes that this will provide me with the extra motivation to continue.

I am an iOS developer at [RedAnt](http://www.redant.com), before that I worked with some awesome people at [The Other Media](http://www.othermedia.com).
I studied Electronic and Computer Engineering at the [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk), although I have enjoy learning on my own mainly by breaking stuff.

I mess around in **Python**, **Ruby on Rail** and 
**Android**. I am currently deploying most of my stuff on **Rackspace** but I am slowly warming up to **Amazon EC2** (this topic deserves a blog post).
I hate all the recruiter spam on linkedin, I hate emails, I also hate the London tube during rush hour. And my surname is BOSIRE (BO-SEE-RAY) not BO-SA-YAH and definitely not BO-ZEE-YEH
